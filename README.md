# scripts
Some bash scripts I made for my linux environment that I think other people should enjoy :)

[avbox](https://github.com/dvcky/scripts/tree/main/avbox) - A script that creates an audio (REAPER) and video (DaVinci Resolve) production environment on any Linux desktop system with an AMD GPU that supports Distrobox with ease!

[qaac4linux](https://github.com/dvcky/scripts/tree/main/qaac4linux) - QAAC for linux, all bundled in a convenient little package!
